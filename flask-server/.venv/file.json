The Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to fund its existing and prospective debt requirements is managed by maintaining diversified funding sources with adequate committed funding lines from high quality lenders, and by monitoring rolling short-term forecasts of the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash and gross debt on the basis of expected cash flows. Long-term cash flows are projected to assist with the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term debt financing plans.

The existing and potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered when applying estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the financial statements, including the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of impairment of assets.

{"text": "Acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures The initial accounting on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entities. The fair values of tangible assets and right-of-use assets are determined by independent valuers by reference to market prices or present value of expected net cash flows from the assets. Any changes in the assumptions used and estimates made in determining the fair values, and management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to measure reliably the contingent liabilities of the acquired entity will impact the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities.", "pagenum": "122", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}
{"text": "On initial acquisition or acquisition of further interests in an entity, an assessment of the level of control or influence exercised by the Group is required. For entities where the Group has a shareholding of less than 50%, an assessment of the Group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level of voting rights, board representation and other indicators of influence is performed to consider whether the Group has de facto control, requiring consolidation of that entity, or significant influence, requiring classification as an associate, or joint control, requiring classification as a joint venture.", "pagenum": "122", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}
{"text": "Leases Liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets arising from leases are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rates implicit in the leases, or if that rate cannot be readily determinable, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group generally uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.", "pagenum": "122", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}
{"text": "The Group applies the incremental borrowing rate with reference to the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term as that of the lease, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in the country where it is located.", "pagenum": "122", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}
{"text": "Lease payments to be made during the lease term will be included in the measurement of a lease liability.

{"text": "The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, the Group considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the options impacts the lease terms, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised.", "pagenum": "122", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}

{"text": "Pension obligations continued The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligations.", "pagenum": "123", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}

{"text": "Impairment of assets The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other assets that have indefinite useful lives suffered any impairment. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use, calculated on the basis of management\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assumptions and estimates. Changing the key assumptions, including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the value-in-use calculations.", "pagenum": "123", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}
{"text": "Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.", "pagenum": "123", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}
{"text": "Provision of deferred tax follows the way management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related assets or liabilities, which the management may expect to recover through use, sale or combination of both.

{"text": "Buying income The Group receives buying income, including supplier incentives, rebates and discounts, which are deducted from cost of sales on an accrual basis.

The Group has assessed the impact of buying income recognised incorrectly in prior years on the consolidated financial statements and determined that the impact was not material to the consolidated financial statements of any prior financial years and therefore did not require a prior year restatement. The amount has been recorded through underlying results.", "pagenum": "123", "doc_num": "dairy-farm_ar2020pdf"}
{"text": "Non-trading items The Group uses underlying business performance in its internal financial reporting to distinguish between the underlying profits and non-trading items.
